# How to solve cross-origin (CORS) issues with Nginx reverse proxy

## What is cross-origin?

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent malicious websites from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the original web page. This is important for protecting user data and preventing unauthorized access to resources.

When a web page makes a request to a different domain, the browser checks if the server at that domain allows cross-origin requests. If it does not, the browser blocks the request and raises a CORS error.

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://example.com/api/data' from origin 'http://yourdomain.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Why cross-origin issues matter?

Cross-origin issues matter because they can prevent legitimate requests from being processed, leading to broken functionality in web applications.

For example, if you are visiting a web page, then the web page makes an AJAX request to a different domain, such as your online banking service or online shopping site. Without the protection of CORS, the eval web page could potentially access your bank account information such as your balance, transaction history, and other sensitive data, or even make unauthorized transactions on your behalf.

## How to solve cross-origin issues with Nginx reverse proxy

First, you should garantee that your demand is reasonable. As we discussed above, cross-origin issues are a security feature implemented by web browsers to protect users from malicious websites.

Use Nginx reverse proxy to solve cross-origin issues is a common practice. By configuring Nginx to add the appropriate CORS headers to the response, you can allow cross-origin requests from specific domains or all domains.

An example of Nginx configuration to solve cross-origin issues is as follows:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend_server;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

        # Add CORS headers
        add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*';
        add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, POST, OPTIONS';
        add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'Content-Type, Authorization';

        # Handle preflight requests
        if ($request_method = OPTIONS) {
            add_header 'Access-Control-Max-Age' 86400;
            add_header 'Content-Length' 0;
            return 204;
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we are allowing cross-origin requests from any domain (`*`). You can replace `*` with a specific domain if you want to restrict access to only that domain.

The `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header specifies which HTTP methods are allowed for cross-origin requests, and the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header specifies which headers are allowed in the request.

The `Access-Control-Max-Age` header specifies how long the results of a preflight request can be cached by the browser.

The `if` block handles preflight requests, which are sent by the browser before making a cross-origin request to check if the server allows it.If the request method is `OPTIONS`, we return a `204 No Content` response with the appropriate CORS headers.

You can adjust the configuration according to your needs. Take special care with `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, if you are using custom headers in your requests, you need to add them to this header.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, cross-origin issues are an important security feature implemented by web browsers to protect users from malicious websites. However, they can also cause legitimate requests to be blocked. By using Nginx reverse proxy to add the appropriate CORS headers to the response, you can allow cross-origin requests from specific domains or all domains.

This is a common practice in web development and can help to solve cross-origin issues effectively.

Please note that allowing cross-origin requests from all domains can expose your application to security risks, so it is important to carefully consider the implications of this configuration and restrict access to only trusted domains whenever possible.
